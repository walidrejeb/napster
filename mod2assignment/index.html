					shrimp
				</h2>
				<p>
					Table manners for shrimp served as a main course. Shrimp served as a main course are eaten with a knife and fork. When squeezing lemon over the shrimp, use your cupped hand or a spoon to shield other diners from squirts. If sauce is served in a separate bowl, dip your shrimp into it only if the bowl is yours alone; if the dish is communal, either spoon a small pool of sauce onto your dinner plate for dipping or spoon it over your shrimp.

                    In some shrimp dishes, including garlic prawns, the shrimp are served unpeeled. Pick up a shrimp, insert a thumbnail under the shell at the top end to loosen it, then work the shell free. An extra plate should be provided to hold the discarded shells.

					Sushi
				</h2>
				<p>
					To enjoy sushi, grab it with your chopsticks and eat it up. When using condiments like soy sauce, turn the sushi upside down to dip the fish or topping part in the soy sauce. If you dip the rice part in the soy sauce, the rice will absorb too much soy sauce, and the sushi will be too salty.
                    However, turning over the sushi with your chopstick is pretty difficult for beginners. For those of you who are not chopstick experts yet, you can use your hand.
                    Pick up the sushi with your hand. Turn the sushi upside down with your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger so that the fish part will fall on your tongue. This is said to be the proper way to eat sushi: the rice part wonâ€™t get soaked in the soy sauce, allowing you to eat the sushi beautifully.
